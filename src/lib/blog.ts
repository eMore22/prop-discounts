    content: `# How to Pass Any Prop Firm Challenge: 10 Proven Strategies

Passing a prop firm challenge requires more than just trading skills. You need a strategic approach that balances profit targets with strict risk management.

## 1. Start Conservative - Don't Rush the Profit Target

**The Mistake:** Most traders fail by taking excessive risks in the first few days.

**The Solution:** Aim for 1-2% profit per week. With unlimited time on most challenges, there's no need to rush.

## 2. Risk Only 0.5-1% Per Trade

This is THE most important rule. With a 5% daily loss limit and 1% risk per trade, you can survive 5 losing trades in a row.

## 3. Trade During High Liquidity Sessions

**Best Times to Trade:**
- London Open (8:00-11:00 GMT)
- New York Open (13:00-16:00 GMT)
- London-NY Overlap (13:00-16:00 GMT)

## 4. Use Hard Stop Losses - Always

Never trade without a stop loss. Set your stop based on technical levels and your risk tolerance.

## 5. Meet Minimum Trading Days Efficiently

Spread out your trading days - quality over quantity matters.

## 6. Keep a Trading Journal

Track every trade to identify patterns in your winning and losing trades.

## 7. Don't Revenge Trade After Losses

After a losing trade, stop for at least 2 hours before re-entering.

## 8. Avoid Trading Major News Events

Unless you're experienced, avoid NFP, FOMC, and other high-impact news.

## 9. Take Profit at Reasonable Levels

Don't be greedy - scale out if needed.

## 10. Practice on a Demo First

Trade the exact rules on demo for 2 weeks before buying a challenge.

## Conclusion

With these strategies and our discount codes, you'll increase your success rate and save money.`,

    content: `# 5 Prop Firm Scams to Avoid in 2026

The prop trading industry has exploded in popularity, but with growth comes bad actors. In 2026, an estimated 20% of "prop firms" are either outright scams or use unethical practices.

## 🚨 Red Flag #1: No Trader Payouts Verified

If a firm claims to pay traders but provides zero verifiable evidence, that's a massive red flag.

## 🚨 Red Flag #2: Constantly Changing Rules

Firms that change rules retroactively to avoid paying traders are scams.

## 🚨 Red Flag #3: Unrealistic Promises

If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Watch for "100% profit split" or "No drawdown limits."

## 🚨 Red Flag #4: Poor Customer Support

Firms that go silent after taking your money are major red flags.

## 🚨 Red Flag #5: Hidden Fees & Charges

The challenge cost should include everything - watch for hidden platform fees and withdrawal charges.

## How to Identify Legitimate Prop Firms

✅ Established presence (3+ years)
✅ Verified payout proofs
✅ Transparent rules
✅ Responsive support
✅ Clear fee structure

## Conclusion

By recognizing these red flags, you'll protect your money and only work with legitimate firms. Use our verified discount codes only with firms we've personally vetted.`,
